# Description

In the far north, a beautiful princess lived in a kingdom called Jiumei.
The king was always complacent about this, but the princess was always unhappy because the king always kept her in his palace, so she never set foot outside the palace since she was a child.
Although the palace has all kinds of jewelry and never-ending food and toys, but from childhood to adulthood, the princess has been bored with this.<br>
<br>
One day, while the King of Taiyi was on a tour, Princess Pineapple conspired with the guards in the palace to sneak out and enjoy the outside world, but to her horror, the ugly king of the kingdom next door King Guanjie has always imagined that one day he would be able to bring Princess Fengni home to match his son, no matter what means he uses.
When he saw that the princess had escaped on her own, Guan Jie would not let go of this opportunity and ordered the princess to be taken back to the Ugly Kingdom.
When the king returned to the kingdom, he was so angry that he almost had a stroke when he learned that the princess had disappeared, and immediately dismissed the guards at the gate. <br>
<br>
After two days, the princess was still missing. When the king was worried, King Guanjie of the Ugly Kingdom sent a special envoy to the King of Taiyi, saying <br>
"The prince of Xuancheng has gotten tired of the princess, and there is only one condition to get her back, that is, to break the 7 trials of Tower of Hanoi in our city walls. I will release the princess back to you!"<br>
After hearing the news, the king issued an order, calling on all Adventurer to rescue the princess, and as long as they succeeded in rescuing the princess, they could inherit the prince of charming.
The princess will be inherited if she is rescued.<br>
